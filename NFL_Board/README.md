## Notes

**While completing this web app, I encountered several challenges:**
-Adjusting the grid layout and aligning all images to the same size to ensure a uniform appearance.

- Ensuring the app works seamlessly on both mobile and desktop screens.

- Not including all NFL teams yet (coming soon).

- Resizing the text for stats, standings, and team information for better readability.

- The biggest challenge was making sure I was always working in the correct folder and importing the right files.
